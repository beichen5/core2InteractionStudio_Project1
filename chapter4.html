            <div class="moment"><p>At that moment I <span>felt</span> <span>within me</span> <span>and</span> <span>around me</span> <span>something invisible</span> <span>and</span> <span>intangible</span> <span>pullulating.</span> It was not the pullulation of <span>two divergent,</span> <span>parallel,</span> <span>and finally converging sarmies,</span> <span>but an agitation</span> <span>more inaccessible,</span> <span>more intimate,</span> prefigured by <span>them</span> <span>in some way.</span> Stephen Albert continued:</p></div>  
            <div class="do"><p>"I do not think that <span>your illustrious ancestor</span> <span>toyed</span> <span>idly with</span> <span>variations.</span> I do not find it <span>believable</span> that <span>he would waste</span> <span>thirteen years</span> laboring over a never ending experiment in rhetoric. <span>In your country</span> <span>the novel</span> is an inferior genre; in Ts'ui Pen's period, <span>it</span> <span>was</span> <span>a despised one.</span> Ts'ui Pen was <span>a fine novelist</span> but he was also a man of <span>letters who, doubtless,</span> <span>considered himself</span> more than <span>a mere novelist.</span> The testimony of <span>his contemporaries</span> <span>attests to this,</span> and certainly the known facts of <span>his life</span> confirm his leanings <span>toward</span> <span>the metaphysical</span> <span>and the mystical.</span> <span>Philosophical conjectures</span> take up the greater part of his novel. I know that of all problems, <span>none disquieted him more,</span> <span>and none</span> concerned him more than <span>the profound one of time.</span> Now then, this is <span>the only problem</span> that does not figure in <span>the pages</span> <span>of The Garden.</span> He does not even use the word which means <span>time.</span> How can these <span>voluntary omissions</span> be explained?"</p></div>
        </div>
        <div class="row2">
            <div class="proposed"><p><span>I proposed</span> <span>various solutions,</span> all of them inadequate. <span>We discussed them.</span> Finally <span>Stephen Albert</span> said: "<span>In a guessing game</span> to which the answer is <span>chess,</span> which word is <span>the only one</span> <span>prohibited?</span>" I thought for <span>a moment</span> <span>and</span> <span>then replied:</span></p></div> 
            <div class="word"><p>"The word is <span>chess.</span>"</p></div>
            <div class="precisely">"<p><span>Precisely,</span>" said Albert. "The Garden of Forking Paths is <span>an enormous guessing game,</span> <span>or parable,</span> in which <span>the subject</span> <span>is</span> <span>time.</span> <span>The rules of the game</span> <span>forbid</span> <span>the use of the word itself.</span> <span>To eliminate</span> <span>a word</span> <span>completely,</span> to refer to it <span>by means</span> of <span>inept phrases</span> <span>and</span> <span>obvious paraphrases,</span> is perhaps the best way of <span>drawing attention</span> <span>to it.</span> This, then, is <span>the tortuous method</span> <span>of</span> <span>approach</span> <span>preferred by</span> <span>the oblique Ts'ui Pen</span> <span>in every meandering</span> <span>of</span> <span>his interminable novel.</span> I have gone over hundreds of manuscripts, I have <span>corrected errors</span> <span>introduced by careless copyists,</span> I have worked out the plan from <span>this chaos,</span> I have <span>restored,</span> or <span>believe I have restored,</span> <span>the original.</span> <span>I have translated the whole work.</span> I can <span>state categorically</span> that not once <span>has the word time</span> <span>been used in</span> <span>the whole book.</span></p></div>
            <div class="explanation"><p>"The explanation is obvious. The Garden of Forking Paths <span>is a picture,</span> <span>incomplete yet not false,</span> of <span>the universe</span> such as <span>Ts'ui Pen</span> <span>conceived it to be.</span> Differing from <span>Newton and Schopenhauer,</span> <span>your ancestor</span> did not think of <span>time</span> <span>as</span> <span>absolute and uniform.</span> He believed in <span>an infinite series of times,</span> <span>in a dizzily growing,</span> <span>ever spreading network</span> of diverging, <span>converging</span> <span>and parallel times.</span> This web of time - <span>the strands of which approach one another,</span> <span>bifurcate,</span> <span>intersect</span> <span>or ignore each other</span> <span>through the centuries</span> - embraces every possibility. We do not exist in most of them. <span>In some you exist and not I,</span> while in others I do, and <span>syou do not,</span> and in yet <span>others both of us exist.</span> <span>In this one,</span> in which <span>chance has favored me,</span> <span>you have come</span> <span>to my gate.</span> In another, you, <span>crossing the garden,</span> have found me dead. <span>In yet another,</span> I say these <span>very same words,</span> <span>but am an error,</span> <span>a phantom.</span>"</p></div>
        </div>
        <div class="row3">
                <div class="in"><p>"<span>In all of them,</span>" I enunciated, <span>with a tremor in my voice.</span> "I deeply <span>appreciate</span> <span>and am grateful</span> to you for <span>the restoration</span> of <span>Ts'ui Pen's garden.</span>"</p></div>
                <div class="not"><p>"<span>Not in all,</span>" he murmured with a smile. "Time is <span>forever dividing itself</span> <span>toward innumerable futures</span> <span>and in one of them</span> I am your enemy."</p></div>
                <div class="once"><p>Once again I <span>sensed</span> <span>the pullulation</span> of which I have already spoken. <span>It seemed to me</span> <span>that the dew-damp garden</span> surrounding the house was <span>infinitely saturated</span> <span>with invisible people.</span> <span>All were Albert and myself,</span> <span>secretive,</span> <span>busy</span> <span>and multiform</span> <span>in other dimensions</span> of time. I lifted my eyes and <span>the short nightmare</span> disappeared. In the black and yellow garden there was <span>only a single man,</span> but <span>this man</span> <span>was</span> <span>as strong as</span> <span>a statue</span> <span>and this man</span> <span>was walking up</span> <span>the path</span> and he was Captain Richard Madden.</p></div>
                <div class="future"><p>"The future <span>exists now,</span>" I replied. "But I am <span>your friend.</span> Can I <span>take another look</span> <span>at the letter?</span>"</p></div>
                <div class="albert"><p>Albert <span>rose from his seat.</span> He <span>stood up tall</span> as he <span>opened the top drawer</span> of the high writing cabinet. <span>For a moment his back was again turned to me.</span> I had <span>the revolver</span> ready. I <span>fired</span> <span>with the utmost care:</span> Albert <span>fell without a murmur,</span> at once. I swear that <span>his death was instantaneous,</span> as if he had been <span>struck by lightning.</span></p></div>
                <div class="what"><p>What remains is <span>unreal and unimportant.</span> Madden <span>broke in</span> <span>and arrested me.</span> I have been <span>condemned to hang.</span> Abominably, I have yet <span>triumphed!</span> <span>The secret name</span> <span>of the city</span> <span>to be attacked</span> <span>got through</span> <span>to Berlin.</span> Yesterday <span>it was bombed.</span> I read the news in the same English newspapers which <span>were trying to solve the riddle</span> <span>of the murder</span> <span>of</span> <span>the learned Sinologist Stephen Albert</span> <span>by the unknown Yu Tsun.</span> <span>The Chief,</span> however, had already <span>solved this mystery.</span> He knew that <span>my problem was to shout,</span> <span>with my feeble voice,</span> <span>above the tumult of war,</span> the name of the city called <span>Albert,</span> and that I had no other course open to me than <span>to kill someone of that name.</span> He does not know, <span>for no one can,</span> of <span>my infinite penitence</span> <span>and sickness of the heart.</span></p></div>
