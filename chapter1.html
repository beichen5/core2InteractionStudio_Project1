    <div class="p1">
        <p class="and">.. and I hung up the phone. Immediately I recollected the voice that had spoken in German. It was that of Captain Richard Madden. Madden, in Viktor Runeberg's office, meant the end of all our work and - though this seemed a secondary matter, or should have seemed so to me - of our lives also. His being there meant that Runeberg had been <span id="w1" class="arrested">arrested or murdered</span>. 1 Before the sun set on this same day, I ran the same risk. Madden was implacable. Rather, to be more accurate, he was obliged to be <span id="w2" class="implacable">implacable</span>. An Irishman in the service of England, a man suspected of equivocal feelings if not of actual treachery, how could he fail to welcome and seize upon this extraordinary piece of luck: the discovery, capture and perhaps the deaths of two agents of Imperial Germany?</p>
    </div>
    <div id="p2" class="p2">
        <p class="then">Then I reflected that all things happen, happen to one, precisely now. Century follows century, and things happen only in the present. There are <span id="w3" class="countless">countless</span> men in the air, on land and at sea, and all that really happens happens to me... The almost unbearable memory of Madden's long horseface put an end to these wandering thoughts.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="p3" class="p3">
        <div class="went">I went up to my bedroom. Absurd though the gesture was, I closed and locked the door. I threw myself down on my narrow iron bed, and waited on my back. The never changing rooftops filled the window, and the hazy six o'clock sun hung in the sky. It seemed incredible that this day, a day without warnings or omens, might be that of my implacable death. In despite of my dead father, in despite of having been a child in one of the symmetrical gardens of Hai Feng, was I to die now?</div>
    </div>
    <div id="p4" class="p4">
        <p class="in">In the midst of my hatred and terror (now that it no longer matters to me to speak of terror, now that I have outwitted Richard Madden, now that my neck hankers for the hangman's noose), I knew that the fast-moving and doubtless happy soldier did not suspect that I possessed the <span id="w4" class="secret">Secret</span> - the name of the exact site of the new British artillery park on the Ancre. A bird streaked across the misty sky and, absently, I turned it into an airplane and then that airplane into many in the skies of France, shattering the artillery park under a rain of bombs. If only my mouth, before it should be silenced by a bullet, could shout this name in such a way that it could be heard in Germany... My voice, my human voice, was weak. How could it reach the ear of the Chief? The ear of that sick and hateful man who knew nothing of Runeberg or of me except that we were in Staffordshire. A man who, sitting in his arid Berlin office, leafed infinitely through newspapers, looking in vain for news from us. I said aloud, "I must flee."</p>
    </div>
    <div id="p5" class="p5">
        <p class="sat">I sat up on the bed, in <span id="w5" class="senseless">senseless and perfect silence</span>, as if Madden was already peering at me. Something - perhaps merely a desire to prove my total penury to myself - made me empty out my pockets. I found just what I knew I was going to find. The American watch, the nickel-plated chain and the square coin, the key ring with the useless but compromising keys to Runeberg's office, the notebook, a letter which I decided to destroy at once (and which I did not destroy), a five shilling piece, two single shillings and some pennies, a red and blue pencil, a handkerchief - and a revolver with a single bullet. Absurdly I held it and weighed it in my hand, to give myself courage. Vaguely I thought that a pistol shot can be heard for a great distance.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="p6" class="p6">
        <p class="ten">In ten minutes I had developed my plan. The telephone directory gave me <span id="w6" class="name">the name of the one person</span> capable of passing on the information. He lived in a suburb of Fenton, less than half an hour away by <span id="w7" class="train">train</span>.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="p7" class="p7">
        <div class="timorous">I am a timorous man. I can say it now, now that I have brought my incredibly risky plan to an end. It was not easy to bring about, and I know that its execution was terrible. I did not do it for Germany - no! Such a barbarous country is of no importance to me, particularly since it had degraded me by making me become a spy. Furthermore, I knew an Englishman - a modest man - who, for me, is as great as Goethe. I did not speak with him for more than an hour, but during that time, he was Goethe.</div>
    </div>
    <div id="p8" class="p8">
        <div class="carried">I carried out my plan because I felt the Chief had some fear of those of my race, of those uncountable forebears whose culmination lies in me. I wished to prove to him that a yellow man could <span id="w8" class="save">save his armies</span>. Besides, I had to escape the Captain. His hands and voice could, at any moment, <span id="w9" class="knock">knock and beckon</span> at my door.</div>
    </div>
    <div id= "p9" class="p9">
        <div class="going">I was going to the <span id="w10" class="village">village of Ashgrove</span>, but took a ticket for a station further on. The train would leave in a few minutes, at eight-fifty. I hurried, for the next would not go until half past nine. There was almost no one on the platform. I walked through the carriages. I remember some farmers, a woman dressed in mourning, a youth deep in Tacitus' Annals and a wounded, happy soldier.</div>
    </div>
    <div id="p10" class="p10">
        <div class="silently">Silently, I dressed, took leave of myself in the mirror, went down the stairs, sneaked a look at the quiet street, and went out. The station was not far from my house, but I thought it more prudent to take a cab. I told myself that I thus ran less chance of being recognized. The truth is that, in the deserted street, I felt infinitely visible and vulnerable. I recall that I told the driver to stop short of the main entrance. I got out with a painful and deliberate slowness.Â </div>
    </div>
    <div id="p11" class="p11">
        <p class="last">At last the train pulled out. A man I recognized ran furiously, but vainly, the length of the platform. It was <span id="w11" class="captain">Captain Richard Madden</span>. Shattered, trembling, I huddled in the distant corner of the seat, as far as possible from the fearful window.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="p12" class="p12">
        <p class="utter">From utter terror I passed into a state of almost abject happiness. I told myself that the duel had already started and that I had won the first encounter by besting my adversary in his first attack - even if it was only for forty minutes - <span id="w12" class="accident">by an accident of fate</span>. I argued that so small a victory prefigured a total victory. I argued that it was not so trivial, that were it not for the precious accident of the train schedule, I would be in prison or dead. I argued, with no less sophism, that my timorous happiness was proof that I was man enough to bring this adventure to a successful conclusion. From my weakness I drew strength that never left me.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="p13" class="p13">
        <p class="foresee">I foresee that man will resign himself each day to new abominations, that soon only soldiers and bandits will be left. To them I offer this <span id="w13" class="advice">advice</span>: Whosoever would undertake some atrocious enterprise should act as if it were already accomplished, should impose upon himself a future as irrevocable as the past.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="p14" class="p14">
        <p class="thus">Thus I proceeded, while with the eyes of a man already dead, I contemplated the fluctuations of the day which would probably be my last, and watched the diffuse coming of night.</p>
